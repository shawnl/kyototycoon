Description: Handy cache/storage server - shared library
 Kyoto Tycoon is a lightweight database server with auto expiration
 mechanism, which is useful to handle cache data and persistent data
 of various applications. Kyoto Tycoon is also a package of network
 interface to the DBM called Kyoto Cabinet. Though the DBM has high
 performance and high concurrency, you might bother in case that
 multiple processes share the same database, or remote processes
 access the database. Thus, Kyoto Tycoon is provided for concurrent
 and remote connections to Kyoto Cabinet. Kyoto Tycoon is composed
 of the server process managing multiple databases and its access
 library for client applications.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.

 .
 The network protocol between the server and clients is HTTP so that
 you can write client applications and client libraries in almost all
 popular languages. Both of RESTful-style interface by the GET, HEAD,
 PUT, DELETE methods and RPC-style inteface by the POST method are
 supported. The server can handle more than 10 thousand connections
 at the same time because it uses modern I/O event notification
 facilities such as "epoll" and "kqueue" of underlying systems. The
 server supports high availability mechanisms, which are hot backup,
 update logging, and asynchronous replication. The server can (and does)
 embed Lua, a lightweight script language so that you can define
 arbitrary operations of the database.
 .
 The server program of Kyoto Tycoon is written in the C++ language.
 It is available on platforms which have API conforming to C++03
 with the TR1 library extensions. Kyoto Tycoon is a free software
